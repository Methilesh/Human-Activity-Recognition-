# Human Activity Recognition using Smartphone Data and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to perform Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using smartphone sensor data. The goal is to predict the activity performed by an individual based on the data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors in their smartphone.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [provide the name and source of your dataset]. It contains [mention key details about the dataset, such as the number of samples, features, and target labels].

## Features

- **Accelerometer Data:** [Explain the format and details of accelerometer data]
- **Gyroscope Data:** [Explain the format and details of gyroscope data]

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- [Add any additional libraries your project depends on]

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Run the `preprocess_data.py` script to clean and preprocess the raw data.
   
   ```bash
   python preprocess_data.py
   ```

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Execute the `feature_engineering.py` script to extract relevant features from the preprocessed data.
   
   ```bash
   python feature_engineering.py
   ```

3. **Model Training:**
   - Train the machine learning model using the `train_model.py` script.
   
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluate the trained model's performance on test data using the `evaluate_model.py` script.
   
   ```bash
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```
